# Switzerland and Beyond

## Linking People, Places, and Organizations

For the history of Switzerland, an abundance of source material, information about places, persons, and organizations has been digitally made accessible through various projects and infrastructures. This project brings together the data side of these ventures by aggregating data from the Historical Lexicon, Wikidata, DBPedia, the Swiss Law Sources Collection, hallerNet, and various other outlets.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the interconnectedness of digitally provided data sets and looming insights in the past of Switzerland but also other subject and topics.
